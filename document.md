## Relationships

- **Users to Orders**: One-to-Many relation. A single user has multiple orders, but each order is for only one user.
- **Orders to OrderItems**: One-to-Many relation. A single order can contain multiple order items, but each item in the order is linked to only one order.
- **Products to OrderItems**: One-to-Many relation. A product can appear in multiple order items, but each order item is related to only one product.
- **Orders to Payments**: One-to-One relation. Each order is linked with one payment, and each payment is linked with one order.

## Indexes

### User Table

- `PRIMARY KEY`: `user_id` for faster lookup and user-related queries.
- `INDEX`: `email` column for faster lookup and user-related queries.

### Product Table

- `PRIMARY KEY`: `product_id` for faster lookup and product-related queries.
- `INDEX`: `name` column for faster lookup and search queries.
- `INDEX`: `price` column for faster lookup and price-related search queries.

### Order Table

- `PRIMARY KEY`: `order_id` for faster lookup and order-related queries.
- `INDEX`: `status` for quick filtering and sorting.
- `INDEX`: `order_date` for quick filtering and sorting.

### OrderItem Table

- `INDEX`: `order_id` and `product_id` for optimized joins and faster filtering.

### Payment Table

- `INDEX`: `order_id` and `payment_date` for faster filtering of payments.


# Handling Product Price Changes Over Time

When dealing with product price changes, itâ€™s important to ensure that orders reflect the price at the time of purchase, rather than the current price of the product. This is handled as follows:

## Price at Order Time

- The `OrderItems` table includes a column `price_at_order` which stores the price of the product at the time the order was placed.
- When an order is placed, the current price of the product is copied into this `price_at_order` field.
- This approach ensures that even if the product price changes later, the order reflects the price that the customer agreed to pay.

# Handling Order Cancellations

Order cancellations must be handled carefully to ensure data consistency and accurate financial reporting:

## Order Status Field

- Add a `status` column to the `Orders` table that can have values such as `Pending`, `Completed`, `Cancelled`, etc.
- When an order is cancelled, update this field to `Cancelled`.

## Reverting Stock Levels

- When an order is cancelled, the system should automatically increase the stock level of the products included in that order by the quantity that was originally ordered.
- This ensures that inventory remains accurate.

## Payment Reversal

- If a payment was made before the cancellation, a record of the payment reversal or refund should be stored in the `Payments` table.
- This can be done by creating a new payment entry with a negative amount, indicating a refund.

## Audit Trail

- For better tracking and auditing, consider adding an `order_history` or `order_log` table that records all changes to the status of an order, including cancellations, along with timestamps and the user who made the change.
- This can be important for resolving disputes or performing financial audits.


## Table Creation SQL Queries

### User Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE user (
    user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    address TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Product Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE product (
    product_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    stock_quantity INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```


### Order Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE order (
    order_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    order_number INT,
    user_id UUID,
    order_date DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending',
    canceled_reason TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user(user_id)
);
```

### OrderItem Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE orderitem (
    order_item_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id UUID,
    product_id UUID,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    price_at_order_time DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES order(order_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES product(product_id)
);

```


### Payment Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE payment (
    payment_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id UUID,
    payment_date DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    payment_method VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES order(order_id)
);
```

## Queries

### 1. Retrieve the Total Number of Orders Placed by Each User

```sql
SELECT u.user_id, u.name, COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders
FROM user AS u
LEFT JOIN order AS o ON u.user_id = o.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_id;
```

#### Explanation: This query counts the number of orders placed by each user. The LEFT JOIN ensures that users without orders are also listed.


### 2. Retrieve the Top 5 Products that Generated the Most Revenue

```sql
SELECT p.product_id, p.name, SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price_at_order_time) AS total_revenue
FROM orderitem AS oi
JOIN product p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

#### Explanation: This query calculates the total revenue generated by each product by summing the product of quantity and price_at_order_time, ordering by total revenue in descending order, and returning the top 5 results.


### 3. Retrieve the List of Users Who Have Placed Orders in the Last 30 Days

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT u.user_id, u.name, u.email
FROM user AS u
JOIN order AS o ON u.user_id = o.user_id
WHERE o.order_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 30 DAY;
```

#### Explanation: This query lists distinct users who have placed orders within the last 30 days by filtering on order_date. The INNER JOIN ensures that only users with orders in the last 30 days are listed.


### 4. Retrieve the Total Revenue Generated in the Last Month

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT u.user_id, u.name, u.email
FROM user AS u
JOIN order AS o ON u.user_id = o.user_id
WHERE o.order_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 30 DAY;
```

#### Explanation: This query sums the total amount of orders placed in the last month.

### 5. Retrieve the List of Orders that Were Canceled, Along with the Reason (if Available)

```sql
SELECT o.order_id, o.user_id, o.order_date, o.total_amount, o.status, o.canceled_reason
FROM order AS o
WHERE o.status = 'cancelled';
```

#### Explanation: This query lists all canceled orders along with the reason for cancellation.
